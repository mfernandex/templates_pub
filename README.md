# Obsidian-template

My personal templates for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Motivation

I started new note-taking method after reading an interesting post about Zettelkasten method in [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25803132). For many years, I was struggling about how to organizing my reading list as well as what I learned. I tried many tools & approaches like using Pocket, using browser bookmark, Medium, Trello, Twitter likes,... Nothing has worked. I kept forgetting about what I has read. Our memory isn't reliable as we might think. Building Second Brain idea has changed the way I learn. Obsidian is my favorite tool to build it. I keep changing how I get the most out of Obsidian.

I would love to share my templates with others, who are interested in learning and want to organizing your learning process better.

### Taking notes tips
#### 1. Creating notes
- Create new Zettelkasten notes when you want to take note about new thing by hot key `Ctrl+N` and pick a template by using hot key `Ctrl+T`
- For books, you might want to add [link to local file](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-link-a-local-file-in-obsidian/5815) so that you can open book from your note quickly.
- If you want to add content later,  just add a `todo` tag in the front matter.
- The note is formatted every time you save your note, thanks to linter plugin.
#### 2.Review a topic/notes

- Notes are organized by topics. Open search and search for tag you want to review. Press `Ctrl+Tab` to view a random note from your search result.
- Any new note should add a `review` tag and remove it as soon as you think it's good enough. To visit a note that need to be reviewed, enter `Ctrl+R` or exec command `Spaced Repetition: Open a note for review`.

#### 3. Track your reading

- I created two Kanban boards to track my regular reading and book reading. I think it really helps when you have multiple things in your reading list.  Again, don't trust your memory.

#### 4. Naming file

- One tip I regularly find useful is adding type of notes in the file name to make them clear, so you can navigate file later easier. For example:
	- Resource notes: `(Resource) Topic name`
	- Kanban board: `(Kanban) Books`
	- Book: `(Book) product`
#### 5. Anki card

- Overtime, you will create new cluster of knowledge. You might want to review this topic using better way than visiting them randomly. So [Anki is your friend](https://aliabdaal.com/spaced-repetition/). Creating new anki deck is simple enough:
	- Add new desk: Add tag about topic in [Spaced repetition plugin setting](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition). I prefer this approach more than turning folder name into deck name because it provides more better control.
	- Add new card: I only used [multiple-line card style](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition/wiki/Flashcard-Types#multi-line-basic) . I choose  `[ ](#anki-card)`  as separator because it's invisible in preview mode.  To add separator, just use template `Create Anki Card` to insert the separator after the first heading of the note. By default, `Term` card is an anki card.

#### 6. Hot keys

 I use a number of hot keys to make quick actions. You can see them in `Hotkeys` section in the setting.
#### 7. Pre-commit
You may want to compress your image files to keep them in control. In order to do this, you need to install pre-commit hook.
I use [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) to compress images. So you need to have this package installed in your system. After that, just install pre-commit hook:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

 ### Automatic gather our ideas
 I use DataView plugin to create automatic list. For example, you can use DataView to gather all your ideas in one place. See [example](20210903091505 - My thoughts (resource).md).
 However, the downside of this approach is that the all the links won't be displayed in graph view. So you might consider manual linking if you need that.
### Stats tracking (optional)
 I also provide some [script](./update_stats.py) to update your reading stats (how many notes you have taken over time). Everytime you want to update git, just run command:
 ```bash
 $ ./update your message without quote here
 ```

 It will add all the new notes, update note stats, generate a picture of your progress and create new commit with your message. Your stats will look like this:
 ![stats](stats.png)

## FAQs

If you wanted to know more about Zettelkasten method, I recommend book [How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking â€“ for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1542866502/) as a good start.

Happy learning :).
